## Week 3 ## â€“ Part 2: Parallelisation
## Overview
This repository contains code and instructions for parallelizing the download of PubMed article references using Python's multiprocessing module. The goal is to compare the performance of single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches to handling multiple download tasks efficiently.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of Python's multiprocessing and biopython library  to speed up data retrieval operations when dealing with time-consuming tasks such as downloading articles. By parallelizing the download process, we aim to improve performance and reduce the total time required to fetch multiple articles.

## Methodology
Step 0: Obtaining an API Key
Step 1: Install and Use the Biopython Package
Step 2: Download Referenced Articles by functions 

## Installments:
biopython library
import ssl
import time
from Bio import Entrez
import multiprocessing as mp
