    "The goal of this assignment is to perform a comprehensive static code analysis on a provided codebase used to create reports from HealthShare Referral Manager (HSRM) files. The task involves understanding the workings of the application, evaluating adherence to software design principles, and suggesting improvements where necessary. The assignment consists of several exercises aimed at exploring different aspects of the codebase."

    "What is a Factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "In software design, a factory is a design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. The main idea behind the factory pattern is to define an interface for creating an object, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This is particularly useful for managing and maintaining code when dealing with multiple types of objects that share a common interface.\n",

    "Encapsulation of Object Creation:The creation logic is centralized in a factory class, so client code does not need to know the details of how objects are created.\n",

    "Flexibility and Extensibility: New types of objects can be added with minimal changes to the code, following the Open/Closed Principle.\n",

    "in this exercise, the factory method is used to create instances of different HsmrParser implementations based on the file format (e.g., PDF, text).And ISP dictates that a class should only implement methods that are relevant to it and not be burdened with unnecessary methods .So, If the HsmrParser interface only contains common methods needed by all parsers, and concrete parser implementations do not include unnecessary methods, then the factory method implementation follows the Interface Segregation Principle.According the classes of pasers type and  HsmrParser that we have yes it follows the ISP too."
